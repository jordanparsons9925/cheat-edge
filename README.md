# cheat-edge
School project for documenting Cheat Engine


The solution file for the testing application was developed in Visual Studio 2015.

The tutorial is set up this way:

Step 1 - You must locate the variable matching the one onscreen, and replace it with 100 to proceed.

Step 2 - You must locate an integer that you do not know using "Unknown Initial Value" and the Increasing and Decreasing value parameters, then replace the integer with 100 to proceed.

Step 3 - You must take advantage of Value Types to find the float value that you do not know. The float increases with the heat and decreases with the cool.

Step 4 - Find the pointer for Step 1 by pointer scanning the variable you find, closing and opening the application and changing the number with the buttons, then rescanning the pointers for the ones that match the new value. Repeat until only a few remain, there are multiple and they don't work perfectly, but are usable while the mouse is not on the form.
