# cheat-edge
School project for documenting Cheat Engine


The solution file for the testing application was developed in Visual Studio 2015.

The tutorial is set up this way:

Step 1 - You must locate the variable matching the one onscreen, and replace it with 100 to proceed.

Step 2 - You must locate an integer that you do not know using "Unknown Initial Value" and the Increasing and Decreasing value parameters, then replace the integer with 100 to proceed.

Step 3 - You must take advantage of Value Types to find the float value that you do not know. The float increases with the heat and decreases with the cool.
